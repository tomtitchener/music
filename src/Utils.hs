--   * DurationSum that is total distance from downbeat
--   * Meter
-- With those, compute:
--   * Duration to next downbeat, small to large
--   * Duration from there to end of current measure
--   * Durations to cover remaining whole measures, if any
--   * Duration in final measure to start of partial beat
--   * Durations to remainder of total large to small
