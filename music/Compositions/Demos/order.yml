        # additional constraints here:
        # - want something identifiable as a single voice:
        #   no huge intervals, overall span of a 12th,
        # - want interesting harmony from eventual combination 
        #   with other voices so keep from strict diatonic
        # - need enough sublists to avoid easily-recognizable
        #   mottos
        # - for simplicity, keep it monophonic, no chords
        # - one thing to watch out for is unique patterns
        #   in the upper or lower range, so for example
        #   I started with a single (f,1),(e,1) in the
        #   top register, which you started hearing as a
        #   repeat because there were other similar bits
        # result is meandering mush, no real tonal center,
        # not very pretty to listen to, some recognizable 
        # pitch sequences
