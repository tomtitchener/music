# repeat.yml:  demo group and section with VoiceConfigRepeat only

# driven:  brief duration of bass voice in 3 8th notes is strong pulse,
# treble repeats in two 6/8 bars, inner voices with some rhythmic irregularity
# harmony: minor ninth with rhythm period of 5 8ths (4, 4, 8)
# having different total durations for four different voices dilutes pulse, but not entirely
# having relatively short dur val (4 6/8 bars) means variations shift regularly
# duration of 384 cycles repeat pattern every four bars, sounds like minor hiccup

# long:  patterned on short, with longer spans for bass, treble rhythms
# starts to jam up some of the squareness of short, with 4 bar period
# longer durations remove some heat, less tiring to listen
# still a very intense, active texture, very repetitive,
# not very different from short
# could try new config mod to randomly highlight one voice by dynamic,
# though swells up and down from background would be more like Reich
# sounds well with orchestral marimba
# and in the end, even fff/ppp dynamic differences weren't very audible,
# at least not for marimba
